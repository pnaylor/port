    <h2>White Label Django LMS</h2>
    <h5>2018 ~ 2020</h5>
    <p>
      This was a project I inherited when starting to work with Oregon Research
      Institute and Influents Innovations. My team and I maintained and enhanced
      the software for a couple years, while expanding it's scope to support a
      dozen different research projects. Eventually, I lead the effort to
      rebuild the LMS in a new tech stack (see the Vue sections for more details
      on that more recent project).

      Breakout style game built using the Pygame library. Extra balls make this
      version more interesting than the original game.
