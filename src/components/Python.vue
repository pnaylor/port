      This Python project was inherited when I started working with Oregon
      Research Institute and Influents Innovations. My team and I maintained and
      enhanced the existing collection of web apps, servers, databases, and
      associated native mobile apps for a few years while expanding their scope
      to support a dozen different research projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few of the many enhancements I worked on included evolving the project
      into a progressive web app (PWA), implementing custom landing pages
      configurable by project managers, and enhancing the web servers to support
      HTTPS encryption with auto-renewing certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I became intimately familiar with the existing platform and
      its limitations. So I lead the successful effort to propose, architect,
      and rebuild the LMS from scratch using more modern and efficient
      technologies (see Vue section for details on the successor project).

      Breakout style game built using the Pygame library. Extra balls make this
      version more interesting than the original game.
