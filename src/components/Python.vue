    <h2>White Label Django LMS, 2018 ~ 2020</h2>
    <p>
      This was a project I inherited when starting to work with Oregon Research
      Institute and Influents Innovations. My team and I maintained and enhanced
      the software for a couple years, while expanding it's scope to support a
      dozen different research projects. Eventually, I lead the effort to
      rebuild the LMS in a new tech stack (see the Vue sections for more details
      on that more recent project).

      Breakout style game built using the Pygame library. The extra balls make
      it a little more interesting than usual.
